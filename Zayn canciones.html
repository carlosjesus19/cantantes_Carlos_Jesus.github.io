    Steal my girl

    Letras:

    She's be my queen
    Since we were sixteen
    We want the same things
    We dream the same dreams
    Alright, alright
    I got it all
    'Cause she is the one
    Her mum calls me love
    Her dad calls me son
    Alright, alright
    I know, I know, I know for sure
    Everybody wanna steal my girl
    Everybody wanna take her heart away
    Couple billion in the whole wide world
    Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
    Everybody wanna steal my girl
    Everybody wanna take her heart away
    Couple billion in the whole wide world
    Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
    Na na na na na na (oh, yeah)
    Na na na na na na (alright)
    Na na na na na na
    Na na, she belongs to me
    Kisses like cream
    Her walk is so mean
    And every jaw drop
    When she's in those jeans
    Alright, alright
    I don't exist
    If I don't have her
    The sun doesn't shine
    The world doesn't turn
    Alright, alright
    But I know, I know, I know for sure
    Everybody wanna steal my girl
    Everybody wanna take her heart away
    Couple billion in the whole wide world
    Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
    Everybody wanna steal my girl
    Everybody wanna take her heart away
    Couple billion in the whole wide world
    Find another one 'cause she belongs to me

    You and I

    Letras:

    I figured it out
    I figured it out from black and white
    Seconds and hours
    Maybe they had to take some time
    I know how it goes
    I know how it goes from wrong and right
    Silence and sound
    Did they ever hold each other tight like us?
    Did they ever fight like us?
    You and I, we don't wanna be like them
    We can make it 'til the end
    Nothing can come between you and I
    Not even the Gods above
    Can separate the two of us
    No, nothing can come between you and I
    Oh, you and I
    I figured it out
    Saw the mistakes of up and down
    Meet in the middle
    There's always room for common ground
    I see what it's like
    I see what it's like for day and night
    Never together
    'Cause they see things in a different light like us
    They never tried like us
    You and I, we don't wanna be like them
    We can make it 'til the end
    Nothing can come between you and I
    Not even the Gods above
    Can separate the two of us
    (Two of us, two of us, two of us, two of us)
    'Cause you and I
    We don't wanna be like them
    We can make it 'til the end
    Nothing can come between you and I
    Not even the Gods above
    Can separate the two of us
    No, nothing can come between you and I
    You and I
    Oh, you and I
    Oh, you and I
    We could make it if we try, you and I
    Oh, you and I

    I don't wanna live forever

    Letras:

    Been sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls, hoping you'd call
    It's just a cruel existence like there's no point hoping at all
    Baby, baby, I feel crazy
    Up all night, all night and every day
    Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
    What is happening to me?
    I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
    And I don't wanna fit wherever
    I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
    I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
    I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
    I'm sitting eyes wide open, and I got one thing stuck in my mind
    Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life, oh
    Baby, baby, I feel crazy
    Up all night, all night and every day
    I gave you something, but you gave me nothing
    What is happening to me?
    I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
    And I don't wanna fit (fit, baby) wherever (wherever)
    I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
    I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
    I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
    I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
    Baby, baby, I feel crazy
    I see you around in all these empty faces
    Up all night, all night and every day
    I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
    Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
    Now I'm in a cab, I tell 'em where your place is
    What is happening to me?
    I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
    And I don't wanna fit wherever
    I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
    I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
    I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
    I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
    I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
    I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
    Until you come back home.

    Perfect

    Letras:

    I might never be your knight in shining armour
    I might never be the one you take home to mother
    And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
    But I can be the one, be the one tonight
    When I first saw you
    From across the room
    I could tell that you were curious
    Oh, yeah
    Girl, I hope you're sure
    What you're looking for
    'Cause I'm not good at making promises
    But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
    And if you like having secret little rendezvous
    If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
    Then, baby, I'm perfect
    Baby, I'm perfect for you
    And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
    And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
    If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
    Then, baby, you're perfect
    Baby, you're perfect
    So let's start right now
    I might never be the hands you put your heart in
    Or the arms that hold you any time you want them
    But that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment
    'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time
    When I first saw you
    From across the room
    I could tell that you were curious
    Oh, yeah
    Girl, I hope you're sure
    What you're looking for
    'Cause I'm not good at making promises
    But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
    And if you like having secret little rendezvous
    If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
    Then, baby, I'm perfect
    Baby, I'm perfect for you
    And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
    And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
    If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
    Then, baby, you're perfect
    Baby, you're perfect
    So let's start right now
    And if you like cameras flashing every time we go out
    Oh, yeah
    If you're looking for someone to write your breakup songs about
    Baby, I'm perfect
    Then, baby, we're perfect
    If you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
    And if you like having secret little rendezvous
    If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
    Then, baby, I'm perfect
    Baby, I'm perfect for you
    And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
    And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
    If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
    Then, baby, you're perfect
    Baby, you're perfect
    So let's start right now.
